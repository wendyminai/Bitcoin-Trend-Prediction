LSTM (Long Short-Term Network) is a kind of Recurrent Neural Network which used in the field of deep learning. Traditional neural networks can't remember previous inputs. But Recurrent Neural Networks enable us to learn from previous sequence input datas. A LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate.
